          <h1>Self-Employed last minute filers - FMHs</h1>
          <p>I targeted self-employed customers who were filing their taxes after the payment deadline. This included customers who may have started their taxes prior to the deadline but completed it after. The goal of this research plan was to understand what areas of friction exist for SE customers, and why SE customers have yet to finish filing their taxes. The expected outcomes of these follow me homes would be to understand pain points with the current SE TTO experience, understand why self-employed customers are filing post payment deadlines, and identify any barriers with S2C for self-employed customers. </p>
