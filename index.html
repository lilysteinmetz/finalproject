            <p>I've always been intrigued by the intersection of technology and human behavior, which led to my passion for UX Design! Whether it's crafting new interfaces or conducting user research, I enjoy the challenge of creating meaningful experiences that resonate with people. In my free time, I'm usually at yoga, dance, or somewhere outdoors!</p>
